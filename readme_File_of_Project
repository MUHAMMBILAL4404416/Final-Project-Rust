Assalamualaikum, My name is Muhammad Bilal.

here are the Below some explaination of the Final Project

I created a (Product struct) to model each product with its name, description, price, and quantity.
I made an (Inventory struct) to hold a collection of products in a vector.
I defined an (enum called Action) to represent the different actions a user can take: adding a product, editing a product, generating a report, or exiting the program.

Then, I built a few tools to make interactions easier:

I made a get_input function to get user input and trim whitespace.
I added a get_number function to ensure the user enters a valid number.
Time to make actions happen!:

I created a (create_product) function to gather information and construct a new product.
I wrote an (update_product) function that handles both adding and editing:

If the user enters a product name, it edits the existing one.
If they just press Enter, it creates a new one.

I put together a generate_report function to print a list of all products in the inventory.
I set up a get_action function to repeatedly prompt the user for an action until they enter a valid one.
